					<h3 class="blue-heading">1. Strategy & Research</h3>
					<p>During our strategy session we will identify your business goals and what needs to be achieved to have a successful project. Then, through research and exploration we identify who your audience is and how we can develop a strategy that will reach and convert them.</p>
					
					<h3 class="blue-heading">2. Wireframe, Prototype & UI/UX Design</h3>
					<p>I recognize that you need a beautiful site to reach your audience. But my design decisions aren't based off of solely what looks good or what I like the most. Rather, design should be used to guide the user through your website and call them to action. By combining both strategy and design, I will create an intuitive experience that accomplishes your business goals. </p>
					
					<h3 class="blue-heading">3. Development, Launch & Revise</h3>
					<p>Your new site has now been developed and launched (Woohoo!), but our work isn't over yet. Your site is a living organism and should be treated as such. To ensure your projects future success, I will analyze, and revise anything that may be causing friction within your site and keeping your customers from converting.</p>
